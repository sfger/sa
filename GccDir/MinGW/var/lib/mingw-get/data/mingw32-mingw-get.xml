      <description lang="en" title="MinGW Package Download and Installation Tool">
        <paragraph>mingw-get is a tool to assist users in the management of MinGW
          and MSYS software installations.  Configured via an online XML database,
          which is managed by the project maintainers, it offers a command line
          driven user interface facilitating selective download and installation
          of packages provided by the project.
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph>The XML database provides maintainers with a mechanism for the
          specification of inter-package dependencies; this permits configuration
          of any package, such that the end user may elect to install just that
          specific package, leaving mingw-get to ensure that all dependencies will
          be automatically satisfied at installation time.
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph>A graphical user interface is planned as a future enhancement.
